	  <p>Landscape photographers often depict nature as pure and chaste, devoid of any human presence or activity.
         The work of <a href="https://www.edwardburtynsky.com/home" target="_blank">Edward Burtynsky</a> may be cited as a notable exception.
         His photographs show the profound effects human activity can have on earth. Human presence in a landscape photograph could be contemplative,
         dramatic or even mysterious.
         The 19th century German painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich" target="_blank">Caspar Friedrich</a>
         used this device with great success.</p>
      <p>October last year I came across a sunset watcher at a black-sand beach. The dune with white clouds in the background
         alone could've resulted in a fine photograph. But what captivated me was the human presence. When the stranger changed to an interesting posture, I released the shutter.</p>

	  <p>With no context this image can trigger the curiosity of the viewer and raise a lot of questions - what is the man staring at, that too with an attitude? Why is the figure on the left crouched and leaning forward
	     and why the crows are circling over him? The clouds rising from behind provide the ideal setting for an apocalyptic drama.</p>

      <p>I had a similar experience early this year when I went to photograph sunrise from an interesting rock formation. The sun was just coming out of the mist, as I climbed to reach a small table-top on the rocks.
         The highest point was still ahead of me. As I stood their gasping for breath, I saw this man already waiting at the vantage point for the sun to come up. Now this figure with the vast
         open landscape before him became my main interest. I soon realized that moving a few steps to the right will reveal a vertical, sharp rock in front of us. It was a perfect
         counter-point to the human being, as if nature was sharing a meditative moment with men.</p>

      <p>I want to conclude with one photograph from a wetland near my home. This could've been just another idyllic, pastel landscape - if not for the man who quite unexpectedly walked into the frame.
         He was walking towards his farmland unaware that he was being photographed. The color of his shirt was the real bonus - a spot of red among cool colors made the image tick.</p>
